Material Design Icons is only around because of the team of contributors.

## Ways to Help

### Have an Icon Suggestion

The easiest way to help is to suggest icons.

### Designer

It's surprising all the different ways the same icon can be conveyed. While the guidelines give good structure having a diverse set of choices allows for continous refinment on new and existing icons.

View the open issues or current icons and submit issues with refined designs. Even if you're just lowering the point count on icons.

### Developer

This site is open source. From the documentation to the front end. Any modification in the `master` branch builds within 30 seconds to production and pull requests are usually accepted very quickly (especially documentation).

The tech stack consists of relatively modern tooling, but is organized to be easy to edit for newcomers.

- Angular 4
- Bootstrap 4 (SASS)
- Content is mostly Markdown files

The endpoints are still being documented and are being worked on to provide more robust functionality.
