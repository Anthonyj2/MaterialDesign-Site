# Webfont Alternatives - Guide

This guide will outline some of the reasons to not use the Webfont and why other solutions that might work better in your use case.

## What is the webfont

The webfont is several font files that your browser can pick from. All modern browsers will pick the `woff2` font file to download. This font as of `v2.7.94` is **145 KB** compressed and growing with each release.

- Large Size (larger than any modern web framework)
- Use only 10 Icons and it includes all.

  In a scenerio where the frontend does not know all required icons it may be ideal to use the webfont.
